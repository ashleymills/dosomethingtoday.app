            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How do I get a new suggestion?</h3>
            <p>You receive one new suggestion per day. Complete or skip your current suggestion to see your next one tomorrow.</p>

            <h3>Can I change my suggestion?</h3>
            <p>You can skip a suggestion if it doesn't suit you, but you'll need to wait until the next day for a new one. This encourages you to give each activity a fair chance!</p>

            <h3>How do I add a photo?</h3>
            <p>After marking an activity as complete, you can add a photo by tapping "Add Photo" on the completion screen. You can take a new photo or choose one from your library.</p>

            <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
